"# WhitespaceAssessment" 

This is the dynamic branch for the Whitespace assessment! This branch can handle any length of input from a .txt file. Two classes: Schedule Driver and Talk class. 

Schedule Driver reads data from seedData.txt and creates Talk objects and adds them to an ArrayList<Talk>. The ArrayList<Talk> is then looped over to print track in the desired intervals for the conference.  

Clone down and run in any java environment
